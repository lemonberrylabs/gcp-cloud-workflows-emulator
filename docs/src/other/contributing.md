# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This guide covers the basics of contributing to the project.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gcp-cloud-workflows-emulator.git
   cd gcp-cloud-workflows-emulator
   ```
3. Create a feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-change
   ```

## Building

```bash
go build ./cmd/gcw-emulator
```

## Running tests

### Unit tests

```bash
go test ./pkg/...
```

### Integration tests

Start the emulator:

```bash
go run ./cmd/gcw-emulator
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd test/integration
WORKFLOWS_EMULATOR_HOST=http://localhost:8787 go test -v ./...
```

The integration test suite has 221 tests covering all step types, standard library functions, error handling, parallel execution, the REST API, the Web UI, and edge cases.

## Code style

- Follow standard Go conventions (`gofmt`, `go vet`)
- Keep functions focused and small
- Write tests for new functionality
- Error messages should be lowercase and descriptive

## Submitting changes

1. Ensure `go vet ./...` passes
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Write a clear commit message describing the change
4. Submit a pull request against the `main` branch
